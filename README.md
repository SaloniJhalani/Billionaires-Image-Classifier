# Billionaires Image Classifier

This project focuses on creating an image classification model to classify images of five entrepreneurs collected from the internet. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify the images of these entrepreneurs. The following steps were undertaken in this project:

1. Data Collection:
* Images of five entrepreneurs were collected from the internet.
* The collected images were stored in an appropriate directory structure for further processing.

2. Data Preprocessing:
* The collected images were cleaned and filtered to remove any irrelevant or noisy images.
* Image transformations, such as resizing, cropping, and normalization, were applied to ensure consistency and optimal model performance.
* The data was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

3. Model Training and Evaluation:
* Various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), were implemented.
* The models were trained on the preprocessed image data.
* Model performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, were calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of each model.

4. Model Selection and Deployment:
* Based on the evaluation results, the best-performing model was selected for deployment.
* The chosen model was saved and prepared for use in production environments.

## Technologies Used:

* Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* OpenCV: Library utilized for image processing and transformations.
* Scikit-learn: Framework employed for implementing and evaluating classification models.
* Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment utilized for code execution and documentation.
